# Proyecto2.DEV.F - Violence in Mexico

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring violence in Mexico through data analysis and visualization. It was part of the training for cleaning data, and the objective was to gain insights into one of the most pressing issues in the country.

## Project Objectives

The objectives of the project were:

1. To clean and explore data related to criminal acts in Mexico.
2. To analyze the trends of criminal acts over the years.
3. To investigate the correlation between violence and the GDP generated by each state.

## Methodology

In this project, various functions and methods were used to explore, clean, and merge data to gain a better understanding and obtain visualizations. The main questions addressed were:

- Question 1: What is the trend of criminal acts in Mexico over the years?
- Question 2: Does violence have a correlation with the GDP generated by each state?

## Findings

After cleaning and visualizing the data, the following conclusions were drawn:

### Question 1:
The crimes committed in Mexico showed a positive trend until 2020. Possible factors influencing this change include changes in security policies, improvements in the security system, or shifts in societal attitudes leading to reduced crime incidence. However, the most significant factor contributing to the change in trend could be the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of strict lockdown measures limited people's mobility, making it difficult for criminals to find targets, resulting in a considerable drop in crime rates.

### Question 2:
There is a correlation between crimes committed per state and GDP. States with higher GDP tend to have higher crime rates.

## Repository Structure

- `data_cleaning.py`: Contains functions and methods for cleaning and preprocessing data, includes code for analyzing trends and correlations in the data and contains scripts for generating visualizations of the data.
- `datasets/`: Directory containing the raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.
